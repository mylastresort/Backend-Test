In this one we will test your knowledge of the back end technologies. We will use express and mongodb.

You will be building an Express API that manages products listings.

The API will have multiple routes and should allow interaction with a database you have to setup. Follow instructions from videos you have watched or resources online.

The API should be able to:

*Create a new product listing.
*Update an existing product listing.
*Delete an existing product listing.
*Return a specific product listing.
*Return a given number of listings, for example n = 10. This number will be different depending on requests and should be passed in a query string.
*Return statistics on the API, like how many listings are in the database.


Each listing will have a:
*title: string, mandatory
*price: number, mandatory
*date of publication: Date, mandatory
*description: string, optional
